# Arctic River Dissolved Organic Carbon Flux (1984‚Äì2018)

This repository contains the scripts, models, and documentation used in the study **"Dissolved organic carbon decline across the pan-Arctic in ice-free season (1984-2018)"**, which is currently under review at *Nature Geoscience*.

## Overview

Arctic warming is reshaping carbon fluxes, with implications for climate feedbacks and global biogeochemical cycles. However, the magnitude and trend of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from pan-Arctic rivers remain uncertain, especially for small rivers. Here, we use multiband statistical models to quantify DOC fluxes from 10,566 rivers and 38,420 catchments to the Arctic Ocean during the ice-free season (1984‚Äì2018), finding a mean annual export of 65.91 ¬± 12.28 Tg C, and a declining trend of -0.44 Tg C yr‚Åª¬π (p < 0.001).

DOC export exhibits strong interannual and seasonal variability, peaking in June, and marked spatial heterogeneity:

Large catchments contribute higher total fluxes.

Small catchments export more DOC per unit area.

Trends diverge across basins: Lena shows an increasing trend, while Ob, Yenisey, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie show declines. Across the pan-Arctic, DOC export is primarily governed by:

Soil carbon availability,

Permafrost-driven freeze‚Äìthaw hydrological perturbations,

Ecological disturbances.

Scaling from micro to meso catchments reveals a shift from source-dominated control ‚Üí hydrological transport capacity ‚Üí transport-mediated loss and disturbance attenuation.
